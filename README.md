This program allows the user to:
1.	Display current MAC addresses of the system
2.	Change MAC addresses of the system either to a randomly generated MAC address, or to one selected from a list of 30 popular computer and mobile companies
3.	Reset MAC address to default

The program is fully functional on both operating systems (tested on Kali Linux, Windows 10, and Parrot OS).
